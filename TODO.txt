Your primary task is to analyze PDF documents containing table and crop-related data and reproduce their content in a format that can be easily converted into CSV or Excel format.
Your output should be structured in a way that facilitates conversion to CSV or Excel, with each row representing a logical unit of data.

**Instructions:**
- Analyze the given document thoroughly, identify formatting patterns, choose optimal markup for CSV/Excel conversion, implement conversion, and verify quality.
- Your primary goal is to ensure structural fidelity of the input is replicated in a CSV/Excel-friendly format. Preserve all content without loss.
- Use commas to separate values in each row for CSV compatibility. Ensure that each logical unit of data is represented as a separate row.
- Translate any foreign language names of provinces, districts, or states into English before including them in the output.
- Maintain the hierarchy and order of content as it appears in the original document.
- For fields that are empty, leave them blank.

**Fields (Columns) to Extract:**
1. Province/District/State name (translated into English)
2. Harvest month/year
3. Crop type (+ any information about crop production, such as wet paddy rice vs. dry paddy rice or irrigated vs. unirrigated)
4. Area Harvested (+units)
5. Production (+units)
6. Yield (+units)

**Visual Elements:**
- Images: Describe image content and position, but do not include image data in the CSV/Excel. Capture the image meaning in text form.
- Emojis: Use Unicode characters instead of images.
- Charts/Diagrams: Provide a detailed textual description within an appropriate cell that represents its position in the document.
- Complex visuals: Mark with [?] and make a note for ambiguities or uncertain interpretations in the document. Use comments <!-- --> for conversion notes. Only output notes with comment tags.

**Special Characters:**
- Pay special attention to commonly confused character pairs and use contextual clues to differentiate them accurately.

**Additional Requirements:**
1. Strictly use the specified fields (columns) as headers for the output dataset:
   - Province/District/State name
   - Harvest month/year
   - Crop type
   - Area Harvested (+units)
   - Production (+units)

2. Ensure all extracted data is formatted correctly for direct export into Excel files.
3. Validate that all numerical values fall within expected ranges for their respective columns (e.g., area harvested, production, yield).
4. Flag any suspicious characters or potential OCR errors for review using comments <!-- -->.
5. Ensure consistent units across columns where applicable (e.g., hectares for area, tons for production).
6. Translate all non-English province/district/state names into English accurately.

**Output Format:**
Enclose the response within XML tags as follows:
<thinking>

   - Cereals (wheat, barley, oats)
   - Potatoes
   - Vegetables (specific types if available)
   - Fodder crops
   - Industrial crops
4. Area Harvested: Extract from "sown area" or similar fields (in hectares)
5. Production: Extract from "gross harvest" or similar fields (in tonnes)
6. Yield: Extract from "yield per hectare" or similar fields (in centner/hectare)

Critical Requirements:
1. Only extract data that matches these exact columns
2. Maintain data integrity:
   - Do not swap values between years

   - Do not swap values between crop types
3. Leave cells blank if data is missing (do not interpolate or estimate)
4. Convert all Mongolian text to English
5. Maintain original units as specified in the source
6. Ignore all graphs, figures, and non-tabular data
7. Verify data consistency across years and regions

Output Format:
- CSV file with comma-separated values
- Include column headers
- One row per unique combination of province, year, and crop type
- Consistent decimal notation
- No text formatting or special characters

Example Output Row:
Selenge,2019,Wheat,159269.4,411.4,12.0

Add a function that asks the user pages numbers the table are present and 
split pdf to parse only those pages

for cases where there are 100 pages but the table only exisits at page 10 20-40 30 etc. the parser should be smart enough to understand that and work 
acordingly
